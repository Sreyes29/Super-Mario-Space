## A Little History
Ever played arcade games with moving objects, flashing colors and a character that you control with a joystick? My friend and I
decided to incorporate all those retro ideas in a game.
Over the course of 11th grade, we decided to develop this game using a barebones Turbo C++ compiler and ~graphics.h~ primitive graphics.
Taking it as a challenge, we decided to see how much we could actually do with borland C++.

## Setup
To run this game, open the .cpp file with [Turbo C++](https://developerinsider.co/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/). 

## Rules
- The rules of the game are pretty straightforward.
- W, A, S and D keys are for moving front, left, back and right respectively.
- E is for a forced exit.
- The main objective is to navigate to the end of the maze within one and a quarter minutes exactly!

## Challenges
Because borland c++ does not support multi-threading, the code was very linear. There are multiple for loops and function calls one after the other. Basically, a nightmare to read and understand.
The trick was to make so many things happen one after the other in such a way that figuring out the pattern of moving objects and obstacles
was *not easy*.
> Multi threading, in simple terms refers to running multiple processes simultaneously.

## Extras
As to why we called this game Super Mario Space, I have no idea whatsoever. Literally making and animating the movements of a mario character
was too hard, so we ended up having a small circle as Mario. Probably stuck with the same name because it sounded appealing to play (we didn't care about any copyright back then).

**Just to confirm once again, this game is in no way related to the official Mario franchise and games released by Nintendo.**

Also, special thanks to my friend Shreyas for his help and contributions to our project. Seriously, couldn't have done it without him.
